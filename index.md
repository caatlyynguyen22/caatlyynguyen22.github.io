### CPSC 120
* Lab 1
I liked lab 1, part one and part two a lot because it was the first time I coded with C++ language. I learned about the clang compile format and it was the first time I used git push. Learning about this "new" coding language with a partner was fun and interesting to be a part of. 
* Lab 3 
Lab 3 was the first lab we used make compile and I liked learning about that and using it in the rest of the lab assignments. Using make was easy to check our format and lint issues. We also started using std::cout and std::cin to print and read messages and that was new to learn as well. Learning these made coding easier to do and understand. 
* Lab 12
Lab 12, part one was another fun lab for me because my partnerand I learned how to usethe magick image processing library. It was cool to see the images being coded in a lab for the first time. This was the most challenging and fun lab compared to the previous ones we have done in this class so far.
